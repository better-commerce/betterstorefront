# BetterCommerce Storefront on Next.js 

BetterCommerce is a **Headless**, **API-First SaaS based**  suite of independent **composable** modules **Ecommerce, PIM, OMS**, **AI Product Recommendations** and **Analytics** that work independently with other platforms as well as it works fully integrated as an end-to-end commerce solution. 

This storefront is an all-in-one storefront based on Next.js, for high-performance e-commerce sites. With a few clicks, developers can clone, deploy and fully customize their own store. The storefront by default works out-of-the-box with BetterCommerce suite of APIs, however can be customized to work with other headless commerce API providers as well.

## Integrations

Next.js Commerce integrates out-of-the-box with BigCommerce, Shopify, Swell, Saleor and Vendure. We plan to support all major ecommerce backends.

## Request flow
- The client side is making requests to NextJS server.
- NextJS server then fetches from the bettercommerce API and returns the data
- You can observe this by opening network tab, you'll see most of the requests are redirected to hostname/api/REQUEST
- If you inspect the request in pages/api/REQUEST you will see that it is calling a different method from the Bettercommerce API

## Folder Structure
- components - here we define all the components and utils to use in the app. A general rule of thumb for components design is to use functional components and make them as encapsulated and small as possible.
- framework - In here you will find all the functions used to communicate with the API
- pages - This is a special folder used by NextJS. Do not rename this. For every file / folder in page NextJS will create a new page. For example if you put a /hello.tsx in pages, the content will be rendered on hostname/hello. Read more here: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages


## Considerations

- `framework/commerce` contains all types, helpers and functions to be used as base to build a new **provider**.
- **Providers** live under `framework`'s root folder and they will extend Next.js Commerce types and functionality (`framework/commerce`).
- We have a **Features API** to ensure feature parity between the UI and the Provider. The UI should update accordingly and no extra code should be bundled. All extra configuration for features will live under `features` in `commerce.config.json` and if needed it can also be accessed programatically.
- Each **provider** should add its corresponding `next.config.js` and `commerce.config.json` adding specific data related to the provider. For example in case of BigCommerce, the images CDN and additional API routes.
- **Providers don't depend on anything that's specific to the application they're used in**. They only depend on `framework/commerce`, on their own framework folder and on some dependencies included in `package.json`
